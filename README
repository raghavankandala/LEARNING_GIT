1. This is a sample readme file to play with GIT to understand it better.

2. I was able to create a basic git repository, create a file, add it to the local index, commit it and push it to the remote repository. Looks fairly simple and easy.

3. The last commit which I did from the experimental branch and pushed it to the remote experimental branch didn't reflect in this master branch. Which means, the differentiation happen only when you push, not when you commit, which is the case with SVN.

4. Trying out my automated cherry pick script that cherry picks the given commit number into the other branches on the same repository.
